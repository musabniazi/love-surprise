          450 days ago, two strangers crossed paths without knowing
          that time was about to change its meaning for them.

          He didn’t plan love.  
          She didn’t expect it.  
          Yet somehow, effort quietly replaced fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between laughs, misunderstandings, silence, and growth,

          Laiba, this is not about grand promises.
          This is about choosing you every day,
          even when days are difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
          And Niazi will always choose effort over excuses,
          understanding over ego,
          and you over anything temporary.

          If time restarted tonight,  
          I would still choose you — without hesitation.

          Happy New Year, my Awan.  
          — Yours, Niazi
