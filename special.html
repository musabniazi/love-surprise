  <h1>Hey Laiba! 💖</h1>

  <div class="story">
    <p>First of all, let me just say… WOW. I didn’t know anyone could be THIS awesome and also slightly crazy at the same time — but here you are, proving me wrong every single day. 😎 Niazi knows it too, because he’s been watching your smile light up the universe like some superpower nobody warned me about.</p>

    <p>Remember that crazy day when we spent 5 hours together after our first meetup? Who even does that? Only legends like us, apparently. 😏 Those 5 hours were like a tiny, magical movie — full of laughs, awkward jokes, and “how did we even survive this without embarrassing ourselves?” moments. And yet… somehow we did, and we came out stronger, happier, and even more in love than before.</p>

    <p>So here’s my official promise to you: from today until forever, I will:
    <ul>
      <li>Make you laugh till your cheeks hurt 😆</li>
      <li>Share all my snacks, because that’s true love 🍕</li>
      <li>Randomly dance like an idiot just to see you roll your eyes 👀</li>
      <li>Be the Awan to your Niazi, the coffee to your morning, the “oops I forgot the keys” to your perfectly planned life 🔑</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>And of course, I hope all your dreams come true — the big ones, the small ones, and the weird “I wonder if cats secretly rule the world” kind of dreams. 🐱</p>

    <p>So here’s a virtual high-five ✋, a million hugs 🤗, 1 hour french kiss and a lifetime of silly, amazing memories waiting for us. Thank you for being you, for making life brighter, and for making Niazi a believer that true love is as real as those 5-hour crazy adventures we survived together.</p>

    <p>Keep being awesome, Laiba, because I’m never letting go. 💖</p>

    <p>With all my heart, <br> Your Niazi</p>
